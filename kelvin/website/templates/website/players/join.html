		Thank  you for your interest in joining The Kelvin Ensemble.  We are thrilled that you are keen to be part of an incredible society!  We accept students from all universities in Glasgow.
		However, due to a great number of people interested in joining, The Kelvin Ensemble runs auditions each academic year for its members.

	<p>
		Thank  you for your interest in joining The Kelvin Ensemble. Unfortunately, we won't be able to play as a full orchestra until it's safe and legal. 
		Until then we plan on a strings only programme for first semester with brass, wind and percussion beginning to rehearse when it is allowed. 
		If you're interested in playing challenging orchestral music with some lovely people, please audition! 
		We can't wait to get playing again.
	</p>

		More details will be provided soon.
